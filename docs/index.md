Spek `2.x` is a complete rewrite of Spek with Kotlin multiplatform support in mind. The DSL is also reworked into
two distinct styles: [specification](specification.md) and [gherkin](gherkin.md).

A dedicated [migration](migration.md) section and the list of [breaking changes](breaking-changes.md) is provided.
If you need the `1.x` user guide then it can be found [here](https://spekframework.github.io/spek/docs/latest).

Stable builds are available at [JCenter](http://jcenter.bintray.com/) while development builds can be used by adding 
the following maven repository: `https://dl.bintray.com/spekframework/spek-dev/`.
