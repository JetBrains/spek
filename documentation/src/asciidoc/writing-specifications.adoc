== Writing Specifications


=== Styles

It is important to know that Spek allows two styles of tests:

* given, on, it
* describe it

==== given, on, it

This is the classic Spek style and what the first version of Spek was based on. The idea is quite straightforward:

A test consists of four components:

* name: which is the class name, indicating what exactly it is we're testing
* given: which defines the context, that is, the conditions under which I'm testing. Can be repeated any number of times for each `name`
* on: which defines the action, that is, what is executing for the test to later verify. Can be repeated any number of times for each `given`.
* it: which defines the actual tests, that is, what to be verified once the action is executed. Can be repeated any number of times for each `on`.

In the case of a calculator, this would be:

[source,kotlin]
.SimpleSpec.kt
----
object CalculatorSpec: Spek({
    given("a calculator") {
        val calculator = SampleCalculator()
        on("addition") {
            val sum = calculator.sum(2, 4)
            it("should return the result of adding the first number to the second number") {
                assertEquals(6, sum)
            }
        }
        on("subtraction") {
            val subtract = calculator.subtract(4, 2)
            it("should return the result of subtracting the second number from the first number") {
                assertEquals(2, subtract)
            }
        }
    }
})
----

Notice that both in this style, as the one below, the entire test is described inside of the Spek constructor. Each specification needs to inherit from the class `Spek` defined
in the `org.jetbrains.api` package.

==== describe, it

The style follows the *Jasmine* and *Mocha* style frameworks, where things are defined in `describe` blocks.

A test consists of a minimum of three parts:

* name: which is the class name, indicating what exactly it is we're testing
* describe: which defines the context of what we're testing. We can nest as many `describes` as we want. Each one should provide more context
* it: which defines the actual tests, that is, what to be verified once the action is executed. Can be repeated any number of times for each `describe`

[source,kotlin]
.SimpleSpec.kt
----
object SimpleSpec: Spek({
    describe("a calculator") {
        val calculator = SampleCalculator()

        on("addition") {
            val sum = calculator.sum(2, 4)

            it("should return the result of adding the first number to the second number") {
                assertEquals(6, sum)
            }
        }

        on("subtraction") {
            val subtract = calculator.subtract(4, 2)

            it("should return the result of subtracting the second number from the first number") {
                assertEquals(2, subtract)
            }
        }
    }
})
----

Notice that both in this style, as the one above, the entire test is described inside of the Spek constructor. Each specification needs to inherit from the class `Spek` defined
in the `org.jetbrains.api` package.

=== Assertion Framework
Spek doesn't have any built-in assertions, luckily there are several libraries in the wild that do. Below are several suggestions:

- `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test` (make sure to use the `-ea` VM option in your Spek run configuration when using this one or Kotlin's built in assertions)
- https://github.com/robstoll/atrium[Atrium]
- https://github.com/npryce/hamkrest[HamKrest]
- https://github.com/winterbe/expekt[Expekt]
- https://github.com/MarkusAmshove/Kluent[Kluent]

=== Scopes
Spek provides 3 types of scopes, which are used to define your spec.

==== Test
Equivalent to test methods in JUnit, normally all assertions are done in this scope. Use `it` to define a test scope.

==== Group
May contain an arbitrary number of nested scopes for better grouping of your tests.

==== Action
Represents an action that will be performed and may contain any number of test scopes. You can think of each `test` as an assertion to
validate the expected behaviour of the action performed.

=== Basic Structure

Your specifications need to inherit from the `org.jetbrains.spek.api.Spek` base class.

[source,kotlin]
.SimpleSpec.kt
----
object SimpleSpec: Spek({
    describe("a calculator") {
        val calculator = SampleCalculator()

        on("addition") {
            val sum = calculator.sum(2, 4)

            it("should return the result of adding the first number to the second number") {
                assertEquals(6, sum)
            }
        }

        on("subtraction") {
            val subtract = calculator.subtract(4, 2)

            it("should return the result of subtracting the second number from the first number") {
                assertEquals(2, subtract)
            }
        }
    }
})
----

Aside from `describe`, Spek also provides `given` and `context` to create `group` scopes.

IMPORTANT: Due to how Spek is structured, `group` scopes are eagerly evaluated during the discovery phase. Any logic that
needs to be evaluated before and/or after `test` scopes should be done using fixtures, which will be discussed in the next section.

=== Fixtures
Spek allows running arbitrary code before and after a `group` and `test` is executed.

NOTE: You can't declare fixtures within `action` scopes.

[source,kotlin]
.FixtureSpec.kt
----
object FixtureSpec: Spek({
    describe("a group") {
        beforeGroup {
            ...
        }

        beforeEachTest {
            ...
        }

        context("a nested group") {

            beforeEachTest {
                ...
            }

            beforeEachTest {
                ...
            }

            it ("should work") { ... }
        }

        it("do something") { ... }

        afterEachTest {
            ...
        }

        afterGroup {
            ...
        }
    }
})
----

=== Ignoring tests
Each scope method have a variant prefixed with `x` (e.g. `xdescribe`, `xit`, etc...), which Spek will ignore when executing the spec.

=== Subjects
NOTE: This feature is currently experimental.

Normally you will only have a single class as the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_under_test[SUT]. Spek provides an idiomatic way
of writing this types of tests and removing a lot of boilerplate code.

[source,kotlin]
.SimpleCalculatorSpec.kt
----
object SimpleCalculatorSpec: SubjectSpek<Calculator>({
    subject { Calculator() } <1>

    it("should return the result of adding the first number to the second number") {
        assertEquals(6, subject.sum(2, 4)) <2>
    }

    it("should return the result of subtracting the second number from the first number") {
        assertEquals(2, subject.subtract(4, 2)) <2>
    }
})
----
<1> Tell Spek how to instantiate the subject, in this case a `Calculator`. This will be invoked for every `test` scope, which means each `test` scope will have a unique instance.
<2> Use `subject` to access the instance of the subject.

==== Shared Subjects
This feature is useful when testing subclasses, removing the need of duplicating test code.

Given `AdvancedCalculator` which is a subclass of `Calculator`, a typical test will look like the following:
[source,kotlin]
.AdvancedCalculatorSpec.kt
----
object AdvancedCalculatorSpec: SubjectSpek<AdvancedCalculator>({
    subject { AdvancedCalculator() }

    itBehavesLike(SimpleCalculatorSpec)

    describe("pow") {
        it("should return the power of base raise to exponent") {
            assertEquals(subject.pow(2, 2), 4)
        }
    }
})
----

This will include all scopes declared in `SimpleCalculatorSpec`.
